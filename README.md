This is a pet project to explore and touch more of incredible work of [Karsten Schmidt](https://github.com/postspectacular). https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella. 

The project is still in progress, so there are some known issues:
  * If you open a channel and there are some new photos, those photos won't be displayed, you'll have to reload the page and you should see them.
  * On the login page, if you want to log in by your phone number, there is a request to get your country location in order to fill the countries menu, but that request could take 1 sec, so if you happen to click on the input and start searching countries, than the request finishes up and updates the country menu that will look unexpected for you.
  * Page loading can be slow on mobile devices.

To logout click on the burger button on the top of chat list, it will show you an option to log out.
